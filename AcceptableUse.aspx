<h3>Computing Resources Acceptable Use Policy</h3> 
<p> 
In support of the Southern Oregon University's educational mission, the SOU Information Technology (IT) department provides computing, networking, and information resources to the University community of students, faculty, and staff. 
</p> 
<h4>Rights and Responsibilities</h4> 
<p> 
Computers and networks can provide access to resources on and off campus, as well as the ability to communicate with other users worldwide. Such open access is a privilege, and requires that individual users act responsibly. Users must respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. This includes complying with policies and obligations of organizations with whom SOU contracts for computing, networking, and information products and services used by students, and employees of Southern Oregon University. 
</p> 
<h4>Electronic Privacy </h4> 
<p> 
Users have a responsibility to respect the privacy of others. Violations of this responsibility include, but are not limited to: 
</p> 
<ul> 
	<li>Using a computer account that you are not authorized to use. Obtaining a password for a computer account other than your own, or giving your password to anyone else. 
	</li> 
	<li>Using the Campus Network to gain unauthorized access to any computer system. 
	</li> 
	<li>Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or exploit security flaws. 
	</li> 
	<li>Masking or forging the identity of an account, individual, or machine. 
	</li> 
	<li>Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communications, or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. 
	</li> 
	<li>Accessing clearly confidential files that may be inadvertently publicly readable. 
	</li> 
	<li>Accessing confidential information about a person (such as their educational records) without their consent or other authorization. </li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Interpersonal Conduct </h4> 
<p> 
Users are expected to follow acceptable standards of ethics and conduct in their electronic interactions with others. Inappropriate conduct includes: 
</p> 
<ul> 
	<li>Using electronic mail to harass or threaten others, or to send inappropriate mass mailings. This includes sending repeated, unwanted email to another user; initiating or propagating electronic chain letters; sending multiple mailings to news groups, mailing lists, or individuals (e.g., <em>spamming</em>, <em>flooding</em>, or <em>bombing</em>). 
	</li> 
	<li>Posting materials on electronic bulletin boards, or otherwise transmitting or reproducing materials that are slanderous or defamatory in nature, or that otherwise violate existing laws or the University's codes of conduct. 
	</li> 
	<li>Displaying obscene, lewd, or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that can be in view of others, or the unsolicited distribution of these materials. </li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Interference with Computer Use or Operations</h4> 
<p> 
Efforts to interfere with the use or operation of University computing resources are prohibited. These include, but are not limited to: 
</p> 
<ul> 
	<li>Knowingly performing an act which will result in the denial of service to other users by rendering equipment or systems unusable or otherwise interfering with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, or networks. 
	</li> 
	<li>Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended to damage or to place excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes but is not limited to programs known as computer viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. 
	</li> 
	<li>Wasting or overloading computing resources. This includes printing too many copies of a document or other unnecessary output; using networked resources for recreational participation in online/network chats and computer games; and high-bandwidth activities such as uploading, downloading, or sharing software, music, video, and other media files, whether through FTP, a centralized service (such as Napster), through peer-to-peer sharing (such as Gnutella), or other arrangement, for personal or recreational use. 
	</li> 
	<li>Unauthorized interception or diversion of network transmissions. </li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Recognition of Other Laws and Policies</h4> 
<p> 
Southern Oregon University complies with all United States copyright laws. Users are responsible for understanding and obeying both the policies set forth in this document and the laws and policies of other entities and organizations. Special attention should be paid to avoid: 
</p> 
<ul> 
	<li>Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Specifically, computer software protected by copyright is not to be copied from, into, or by using campus computing resources, except as permitted by law or as consistent with software licensing. 
	</li> 
	<li>Violating copyright laws and their fair use provisions through inappropriate reproduction, dissemination, or use of peer to peer technologies to obtain or disseminate copyrighted text, images, music, video, or other copyrighted material. 
	</li> 
	<li>Using university resources for commercial activity such as creating products or services for sale. 
	</li> 
	<li>Giving or selling access for an account or services to anyone who would not normally be able to access that account or receive such services (this includes giving access to your own account as well as to someone else's). 
	</li> 
	<li>Participating in any activities that violate existing federal and state laws, university regulations and policies (e.g. Student Computer Lab rules) or terms and conditions for specific electronic services, databases, etc. accessible through the Southern Oregon University or Oregon University System networks. </li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Enforcement</h4> 
<p> 
The University reserves the right to monitor and record on an exception basis, the usage of all computing resources when prohibited, threatening, or abusive behavior has been observed or reported, whether observed by another user or by IT professionals as part of normal system maintenance. The University may use information gained in this way in disciplinary or criminal proceedings. An individual's access to computer resources may be suspended immediately upon the discovery of a possible violation of these policies. Violation of these policies will be reported to the appropriate area for possible disciplinary action. Penalties may be imposed under one or more of the following: Southern Oregon University regulations, Oregon University System regulations, Oregon law, or the laws of the United States. Offenses which are in violation of local, state, or federal laws will result in the immediate loss of computing privileges, and will be reported to the appropriate University and law enforcement authorities.
